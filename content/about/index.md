Hi, I'm **Murilo Andrade**, a technology enthusiast and passionate software engineer. Since the beginning of my journey, I've had the incredible opportunity to get involved in challenging projects that have taught me a lot and helped me grow as a professional.

My professional journey began as an **intern** at the [**Instituto de Administração Pública**](https://imap.org.br "Institute of Public Administration"), where I was later promoted to the title of **Junior Systems Analyst**. It was an exciting time, where I learned a lot about developing and maintaining critical projects for municipalities in various parts of Northeast Brazil. Working with [ASP.NET MVC](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/apps/aspnet/mvc) and Microsoft SQL Server provided me with a solid foundation for my career.

I also ventured into freelance projects, where I worked as a **Fullstack Developer**. Here, I was able to lead the complete application development cycle, from conception to launch. With Node.js ([Nest.js](https://docs.nestjs.com/)) on the backend and Angular on the frontend, I expanded my skills and delivered customized solutions to my clients.

I am currently part of the [**Stone Pagamentos**](https://www.stone.com.br "Stone Payments") development team as a **Backend Developer**. I am involved in projects that have a significant impact on customer service and the success of the company. In my team we use [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/about) ([express](https://expressjs.com) and Nest.js), [Python](https://www.python.org/about/) and [React](https://react.dev/) regularly and we manage our work using the Scrum methodology to ensure the efficiency and quality of our projects.

My technical skills include a wide range of technologies, such as: C# (ASP.NET), [Javascript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/), [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org), [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/about/), [MariaDB](https://mariadb.org/about/), [Microsoft SQL Server](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sql-server) and [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/overview/). 

I have a bachelor's degree in Computer Science from [**Universidade Salvador**](https://www.unifacs.br "Salvador University"), and I also have a [Cambridge English Proficiency Certificate](https://www.cambridgeenglish.org/br/exams-and-tests/first) (B2 level).

Outside the world of technology, I have a variety of interests, from cars to music, series and even a game of pool from time to time. My professional goal is to develop into a software architect, where I can use my passion for technology to create solutions that make a difference to people's lives.

At work, I'm known for my technical and analytical style. I like to explore the problem, think of several possible solutions, evaluate the pros and cons and make informed decisions.

I'm always looking for new challenges and opportunities to grow as a software engineer. If you share my enthusiasm for technology or would like to know more about me and my work, I'd be happy to tell you more. My social networks are available on the main page.
