    <h4>Achievements</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Accelerated customer support workflows in 5x by replacing error-prone Postman-based processes with a web application.</li>
        <li>Reduced lead time for changes in 20x by scripting a selective deployment process over SSH, streamlining manual releases in a non-CI environment.</li>
